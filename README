A few days ago I came across a video showing interfacing a KendoUI DataSource with a RESTful backend.

Only problem was that the author of the video left out some parts of how the app was built. So I decided
to work out the missing bits on my own. This is a demo project to show how to combine a Node/Express
RESTful backend with a KendoUI frontend.

In place of a proper database this app uses a JavaScript object, this is a demo after all.
There is very little data checking going on here, so be careful.

I am not a huge fan of Jade, so I used HBS instead. HBS allows me to use Handlerbars on the server side.
Frankly the app doesn't use templates much and everything could have been done with straight HTML, but I
am probably going to expand the app in the future.

Future additions?:
  MongoDB database
  Backbone.js front-end
